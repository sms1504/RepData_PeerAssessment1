## Loading and preprocessing the data
We use the ```ggplot2``` package to plot the data:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

The data is available in a ZIP file, we can extract the data and read it in to a data frame:
```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

From the activity data, we create an array of the number of steps taken per day:
```{r }
stepsPerDay <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
```

We display this this data in a histogram showing the distribution of steps per day:
```{r }
qplot(stepsPerDay, xlab = "Total Steps Per Day", ylab= "Frequency", bins = 50)
```

The same array can provide the mean and median steps per day:
```{r}
stepsPerDay.mean   <- mean(stepsPerDay)
stepsPerDay.median <- median(stepsPerDay)
```

This tells us:

- Steps per Day (mean):   `r sprintf("%.2f", stepsPerDay.mean)`.
- Steps per Day (median): `r sprintf("%.0f", stepsPerDay.median)`.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

From the activity data, we create an array of the mean number of steps taken in each timer interval. 
We then plot this:
```{r}
avgStepsPerInterval <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
intervals           <- levels(as.factor(activity$interval))
plot(intervals, avgStepsPerInterval, type = "l", 
     main = "Average Steps per Time Interval", 
     xlab = "Interval", 
     ylab = "Mean Steps")
```

Using the same array we can find the time interval in which the most steps are recorded:
```{r}
interval.max <- names(which.max(avgStepsPerInterval))
```
The maximum number of steps is taken in interval `r interval.max`.

## Imputing missing values
We can find the number of missing step entries by counting the number of NAs:
```{r}
steps.missing <- sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```

This indicates that there are `r steps.missing` incomplete records.

Our strategy for filling in the missing values in the dataset is to replace them with the mean value for the time interval.

We create a new data frame, replacing the any NA steps with the mean value obtained from the `avgStepsPerInterval` array we created earlier:

```{r}
activity.imputed      <- transform(activity, 
                            steps = ifelse(is.na(steps), avgStepsPerInterval, steps))
steps.imputed.missing <- sum(is.na(activity.imputed$steps))
```

So there are `r steps.imputed.missing` incomplete records in the imputed array.

We can now use the imputed data and the technique we used earlier to re-calculate the histogram showing the distribution of steps per day:
```{r }
stepsPerDay.imputed <- tapply(activity.imputed$steps, activity.imputed$date, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
qplot(stepsPerDay.imputed, xlab = "Total Steps Per Day", ylab= "Frequency", bins = 50)
```

We can also recalculate the mean and median steps per day:
```{r}
stepsPerDay.imputed.mean   <- mean(stepsPerDay.imputed)
stepsPerDay.imputed.median <- median(stepsPerDay.imputed)
```

This tells us:

- Steps per Day (mean):   `r sprintf("%.2f", stepsPerDay.imputed.mean)`.
- Steps per Day (median): `r sprintf("%.0f", stepsPerDay.imputed.median)`.

Imputting the missing step data has reduced the frequency of the zero-step intervals and distributed, allocating the data to different bins. Consequently, the mean and median values have increased.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
